# ISB26603-Spa-App

## Section A: Application Development
Develop an application that will allow the user to book a facial treatment
appointment through the app. Users are allowed to choose one or more services. The 
list of services provided by the spa is as follows:\
1. Acne treatment\
2. Pigmentation & uneven skin tone treatment\
3. Dark circle & eye bag\
4. Birthmark & moles\
User is required to input their information in the app as follows:\
1. Name\
2. Email\
3. Contact No.\
4. Appointment date\
5. Appointment time\
You may design your app based on your creativity. Be sure to plan a good user 
flow to make sure that this app achieves its outcome which is to book a facial
appointment. Each input needs to be verified (Users are not allowed to leave it 
empty). Create a message that will alert/inform the users:\
1. Any field in the form is empty.\
2. Appointment is booked.\
First-time users are required to register their details as listed in table **users**. 
Users can edit registration details once they register. The app has a database to keep 
all the data. Create a database named **facialdb** which has three tables named **users**, 
**facialbook** and **admin**. The structure of the table is as follows:\

### Table 1: users
| Column     | Type     | 
| ---------- | -------- |
| userid     | INTEGER  |
| name       | TEXT     |

| phone      | INTEGER  |
| username   | TEXT     |
| password   | TEXT     |

### Table 2: facialbook
| Column          | Type     | 
| --------------- | -------- |
| bookid          | INTEGER  |
| userid          | INTEGER  |
| appointmentdat  | DATE     |
| appointmenttime | TIME     |
| services        | TEXT     |

### Table 3: admin
| Column          | Type     | 
| --------------- | -------- |
| adminid         | INTEGER  |
